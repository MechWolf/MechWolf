    <h2>Safety First</h2>
    <p>MechWolf's compiler has your back. Design, simulate, and analyze experiments <em>before</em> connecting to real hardware to make sure they'll work. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Simplicity</h2>
    <p>Follow the same process as in the lab, except now in Python: design an apparatus, create a protocol, execute it, and analyze the results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Interactive</h2>
    <p>Use an interactive browser-based notebook to visualize your apparatus and protocol and then monitor the experiment in real time with live graphs.</p>

### MechWolf doesn't bite.

Install MechWolf in one line:

```
$ pip install mechwolf
```

If you get an error (such as `mechwolf requires Python '>=3.7' but the running Python is 2.7.16`), take a look at the [installation guide](guide/installation). If you're not sure what any of this means, see the [gentle introduction](guide/gentle_intro).
