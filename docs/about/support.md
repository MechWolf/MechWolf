## If you are getting an error message

If the error message is in red, then it means that the error was probably generated by MechWolf.
Follow the instructions given by the message, if applicable.
If the error message is in white, that means it was probably generated by Python (or outside of MechWolf).
Look up the message (you'll likely get a StackOverflow hit) and see if that helps you resolve the issue.
