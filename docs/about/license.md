# License

MechWolf is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3. If you're unfamiliar with software licenses, here is a [handy summary of the license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

One of the key aspects of the GPL is the following section:

> You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
>
> a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
> it, and giving a relevant date.
>
> b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
> released under this License and any conditions added under section
>
> 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
>
> c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
> License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
> License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
> additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
> regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
> permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
> invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
>
> d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
> Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
> interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
> work need not make them do so.

This is a strong protection. It means that any MechWolf derivative, commercial or otherwise, must have its source code made available under the GPL if it is distributed.
If it's based on the MechWolf source code, it will be open source.
